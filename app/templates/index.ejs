          Hello thereüëã<br /><br />
          My name is Tianyi Ma. I am previously a software engineer at Scale AI,
          a leading platform for data labeling and AI applications. I graduated
          from the University of Rochester with a Bachelor of Science in
          Mathematics, a Minor in Computer Science, and I have a strong
          background in data analysis and machine learning.<br /><br />
          I now studies generative AI, NLP, LLM and use those knowledge to study
          AI biases and fairness. Moreover, I'm taking online computational
          social science for fun. I'm also reading Design Machine Learning
          Systems by Chip Huyen to learn about end-to-end ML, because it's not
          enough to just know how to train a model anymore. <br /><br />
          In my spare time, I love to take long walks, read novels, travel and
          discover new places to eat. I've been to more than 15 countries in the
          world, a dozen in Europe, and much more cities. I also adore animals
          and have an orange cat named Butter with my husband.
