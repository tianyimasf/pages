    <p>Hello there👋</br></br>
      My name is Tianyi Ma. I am previously a software engineer at Scale AI, a leading platform for data labeling 
      and AI applications. I graduated from the University of Rochester with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, 
      minoring in Computer Science, and I have a strong background in data analysis and machine learning.</br></br>
      I now regularly dedicate my time deep diving into studies about generative AI, NLP and use those knowledge
      to study AI biases and fairness. Moreover, I'm studying computational social science for societal issues, 
      and also GIS analysis for solving climate change problems. I'm also taking foundational CS courses that I missed
      in undergrad to build a solid CS background, such as OS and programming languages. I'm passionate about continuous
      learning. </br></br>
      In my spare time, I love to take long walks, read novels, travel and discover new places to eat. I've been to
      more than 15 countries in the world, a dozen in Europe, and much more cities. I also adore animals and have an orange cat
      named Butter with my husband.</p>
