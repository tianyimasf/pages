![fungi_classification_2](../images/280_mushroom_species_classifier_2.PNG)

Using Python and fast.ai, pre-processed and trained a ResNet34 model on a FGVCx dataset with 280 different mushroom species and around 45,000 different mushroom images, labels indicated by folder names. Deployed and published using Gradio on Hugging Face: [click here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/tymasf/fungi-classification-280-species), specifically its "Block" concept that is more complicated but more flexible than "Interface". Achieved Accuracy: 0.5654 | Top 5 Accuracy: 0.8347.
