_**3D Visualzation of Stars ⭐ in Our Universe | Mar - May, 2023**_

[The visualization](https://stargazingnight.herokuapp.com/) randomly samples 10k stars in our universe and plot them in 3D with their Cartesian coordinates, absoulte magnitude (radius) and temperature (color). You can play around with the visualization by interacting with the graph like zooming in or out, or set filters on the right panel. This visualization is powered by Plotly and Dash.
