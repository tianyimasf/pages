<p><em><strong>Art History Data Analysis – a Tidy Tuesday Series | 05.09.2023 | <a href="https://github.com/tianyimasf/tidy-tuesday-social-dataset-analysis/blob/main/art_history_analysis/image/complete_demographic_analysis.png">Github</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Tidy Tuesday a wonderful weekly data project in R. They have been running since 2018, releasing a “toy” dataset every Tuesday for the R community to practice data wrangling and visualization. They have super fun datasets, and I’m using them to create this series, documenting my data storytelling journey and hopefully have fun too.</p>
<p>About this very first project: in high school I took AP Art History. Although I only got a 3 out of 5 in the exam, which is one of my worst scores, I loved the subject since I get to look at a sea of artworks. This is why I chose this dataset, as a reminiscence of my high school memory. I’m using R and various R libraries, such as dplyr, tidyverse, and ggplot2. I hope to learn more and more techniques and methods along the way.</p>
<p>In this notebook, I first analyzed the top 20 artists. Then I conducted a complete artist demographic analysis, using pie charts to visualize each attributes, such as gender, race, nationality, and ethnicity.</p>
